# wigwam.directory

A [wigwam](https://taylor.town/pardon-2023#wigwams) is a small-but-mighty
project that reduces public reliance on
[battleships](https://taylor.town/pardon-2023#wigwams).

This direcory was created with the following goals:

- promote "slow tech" over hype
- organize project landscape by goals
- match talent quickly and effectively
- sustainably fund unsexy infrastructure
- keep projects on-schedule and within budget
- maintain list of "open problems" in need of new wigwams
